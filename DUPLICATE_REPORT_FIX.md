# Duplicate Report Issue Fix

## Problem
Users were seeing duplicate reports for the same investor (e.g., "Bhagirath" appearing twice with identical data).

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Multiple Subscriptions**: The `currentUser$` subscription was being created multiple times without proper cleanup
2. **No Report Clearing**: The `reports` array wasn't being cleared before loading new data
3. **No Duplicate Prevention**: No checks were in place to prevent adding duplicate reports

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Proper Subscription Management
- Added `OnDestroy` interface and `ngOnDestroy()` method
- Created `userSubscription` property to track the subscription
- Properly unsubscribe on component destruction

### 2. Report Array Management
- Clear `reports` array before loading new data: `this.reports = []`
- Added duplicate detection in `generateReport()` method
- Replace existing reports instead of adding duplicates

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added console logging to track report loading process
- Monitor report count before and after operations
- Log when reports are updated vs newly added

### 4. Duplicate Prevention Logic
```typescript
const existingReportIndex = this.reports.findIndex(r => r.investorName === investorName);
if (existingReportIndex >= 0) {
  this.reports[existingReportIndex] = newReport; // Replace
} else {
  this.reports.push(newReport); // Add new
}
```

## Expected Result
- Users should now see only ONE report per investor
- No duplicate "Bhagirath" or any other investor names
- Clean, single display of investor data

## Testing
1. Login as a user
2. Navigate to Report page
3. Verify only one report appears per investor
4. Check browser console for proper logging
